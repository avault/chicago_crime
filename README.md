# Chicago-Crime

A small notebook analyzing some Chicago's crime stats, based on a csv file of Chicago's crimes available here:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

The version seen here is a (yet-unchanged) fork of Elaad Applebaum's notebook, copied here so that students could use it as a starting point.

## Extensions
- Normalize months by length of month (suggestion by Elaad in the original Readme))
- This data includes latitudes and longitudes. What is the relationship between number of crimes and distance to the police station, if any? (See [avault/police-stations](https://github.com/avault/police-stations) for an example of analysis using police station data.)
