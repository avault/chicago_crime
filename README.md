A small script to analyze some Chicago crime stats, based on a csv file of Chicago's crimes available here:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

As of now, it reads in the file in a bad way, to deal with numerous issues in the source data. Plan to improve it soon.

## To do

Normalize months by length of month (this is a no-brainer, I just haven't done it)

Read in the file more efficiently, including exception handling
